Can I tell you a story
'Bout a boy who broke his own heart?
And he always blamed everybody else
But the truth is that he did it to himself
He made a couple songs and they got big
He thought that he could do whatever he wanted
But it all left him with a hole in his heart

Ooh-ooh-ooh, money buys you happiness
But ooh-ooh-ooh, it doesn't buy you time

The more that I get older
The less I wanna be sober
And I can't quit, goddamit
And maybe I'm just broken
And I'll never admit it
But I wish that I was younger
Yeah, 26 and I'm rich
How the hell did it come to this?

And I wish I could tell you
Everything is perfect, but it's not
I've been starin' at the ceilin' for like ten days
But I'm pretty sure that I forgot
What it's like to be a person that doesn't think
That everything he does just sucks
Oh, it's so perfect world until it's not
